## TEST RELATED TO JAYA-TECH ENVOLVING WEBHOOKS

First of all, I want to thank for your time to send me the challenge. I thought that was easy, and sounds easy but I spent a lot of time trying to do the authentication, but I couldn't

Always having trouble with Forbidden requests. I couldn't found some solution and I tried some, but nothing worked.

So, no more blah blah, I really upset with me to not finished this, because I spent a lot of time trying to do. And if Jaya team have this solution, PLEASE, SEND ME. I really want to know how to do this. This is a case of life or death :)

I will not describe a setup enviroment, because the test is so poor, that not worth it

I hope you will be able to find someone more senior to the challenge. and I hope I might be trying again in the near future. Once again, grateful for the time. Really enjoyed Jaya, I hope I will join the team in another chance.

obs: If you have this test, please. Send me, I really want to do this! I really really upset because I didn't :)

Thanks Lucas and Jaya Team, see you later.
